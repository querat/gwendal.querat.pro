            <p >I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. If you overwork it you become a
                cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You have to
                allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>
            <p>You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of
                it. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps,
                and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. You can create anything that makes you happy. Decide where
                your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Poor old tree.</p>

            <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. You can do
                anything your heart can imagine. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
            <p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. I really believe that if you practice
                enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. How do you make a round circle with a square
                knife? That's your challenge for the day. The light is your friend. Preserve it. This is the way you take
                out your flustrations. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>

        <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to
            painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Let your heart be your guide. Let your imagination be
            your guide. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. The secret to doing anything
            is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything.
            As long as you believe.</p>

        <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
            framework first. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.</p>
