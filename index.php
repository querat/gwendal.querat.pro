        <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. You
            can do
            anything your heart can imagine. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
        <p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. I really believe that if you practice
            enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. How do you make a round circle with a
            square
            knife? That's your challenge for the day. The light is your friend. Preserve it. This is the way you
            take
            out your flustrations. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>

            When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll
            change
            your entire perspective. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. We have no limits to our
            world.
            We're only limited by our imagination. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as
            you
            are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's have a happy little tree in here. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.
            Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. It's cold, but it's
            beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
            It's a
            good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
            There
            we go. Let that brush dance around there and play.

            You can do anything your heart can imagine. You can create anything that makes you happy. We have a
            fantastic
            little sky!
        </p>

        <p>
            You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it
            always
            looks for the easiest way to do things Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly
            straight.
            Not every limb is perfect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take your time. Speed will come later. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.
            There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. As trees get older
            they
            lose their chlorophyll.
        </p>

        <p>
            It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming
            home
            and having a snow-covered dinner. Just use the old one inch brush. Here we're limited by the time we
            have.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an
            almighty
            tree that fast? That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.
